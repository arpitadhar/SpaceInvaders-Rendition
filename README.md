# SpaceInvaders-Rendition

In this project, I will be taking a SpaceInvaders Rendition that I made back in 2020 and improving upon it. 
The original goal in this game was to avoid the asteroids (red circles) at all costs and get rid of them using the laser. 
There is also a "power up" in this game you can obtain by shooting the green circle. 
I made this game using the P5JS editior and this time I will code it using visual studio code. I will improve the graphics and also make the game more difficult since right now it is pretty easy to win.
